Normally the README is reserved for documentation and for user instructions, on how to use the programms.
But for this one as this is my training repository i decieded to do a little training on how to write them.
By takling for one easy task and most of us know how to do. But making a instruction which will be followed word by word.
This will act as training for writing future documentations and instructions as this is harder to do than it seems like.

A Butterknife 

pre explanations:
When were talking about the "face of the bread" were talking about the biggest area of the bread not the small areas these areas will be called the "side of the bread"
Slicing means that you have to put the sharp side of the knife on top of the thing you want to slice usally you should do it 1cm (0.39inches) from the side of the thing you want to slice in pieces
then you press the knife down till it reached the end of the thing you want to slice and then you take the resulting smaller piece of the thing you just sliced
SAFETY HAZARD: Please make sure that you dont cut your fingers while youre slcing this can easily happen that your finger will slip under the sharp size of the knife
also the best aproach wuold be that before slicing you lay a chopping board under the thing you want to slice

Step 1: 
Lay the stuff written in the requirements out on a table

Step 2:
If your bread isnt small then slice it

Step 3:
Slice the butter and lie the things you sliced onto the face of the bread till you only see about 90% of the face of the bread please make sure that you didnt stacked the butter on top of each other the best aproach is to lay one slice of the butter next to the other slice

Step 4:
Slice the four salami pieces and lay them onto the bread next to each other not on top

Step 5:
Now you can eat it (if you dont know how to eat then i wonder how you survived to read this manual)
